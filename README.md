INTRODUCTION
Things like mental health are not taken seriously in Africa because of the different ideologies or
thoughts that come into people’s minds when they hear this. Because of this kind of behavior, many
people have faced mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts all because
they lack knowledge about what they’re facing and they’re not exposed to the services available to
them. With this software, most people with challenged mental health are reached out with help
from qualified personnel and it also helps the different medical officers to keep track of their
patients.
OBJECTIVES.

2. To educate people about the dangers of mental health issues and remove the negative
perspective that it’s for the rich.
3. To reduce the rate of death that is a result ofsuicide and stress.
4. To help the African youthsthat are struggling with depression and unresolved issues
overcome because they are the next generation.
TARGET CUSTOMERS.
1. People especially students who are facing mental health and can’t afford to pay for the
services.

focuses on youths that are facing the challenges of mental health and don’t have the finances to get
the services that can help them overcome and be free.
